  'We are actively working on a professional version.The available consumer version is not intended or certified for professional use. We would love to keep in touch via email to let you know when we have a professional version.',

  'Not a professional (e.g. providers office, appeal specialist, lawyer, etc.) but still ended up here? Not to worry! You can try the regular appeal generator here.',

  'If interested in being one of the first users, you can also give us $10 to get access for the first three months of the professional beta once we launch the professional version. If you change your mind at any time before or during the professional beta, we are more than happy to refund that. Honestly the $10 is to show that folks are willing to pay for it so we can get more resources.',
